# ABSTRACT

**A brief abstract at the beginning summarises and highlights the major points of your paper.
Check your margins! They should print so that both the left and right margins are ¾ inch.**

Continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) are playing a pivotal role in ensuring that R packages in Pharma meet the highest standards. Focus is placed on ensuring that packages are fit for purpose for both internal systems as well as the various requirements for CRAN/BioConductor. In this talk, we discuss best practices that were adopted into making developer-friendly and efficient CI/CD pipelines and the impact that these pipelines have had in the open-source Pharma community and at Roche/Genetech. Two case studies of package and pipelines will be discussed - one on a beginner level and one on an advanced level. The first will be CI/CD workflows for the admiral R package, used for building ADaM datasets, and presented from the perspective of a newcomer to CI/CD. The second case will be regarding the NEST framework, which will have more advanced discussions presented by an experienced CI/CD developer.  

# INTRODUCTION

**The introduction explains the purpose and scope of your paper and provides readers with any general information
they need to understand your paper.**

Both large and software projects can greatly benefit from employing CI/CD into their processes.  A lone software developer maintaining a project can benefit from continually checking that their software runs under current dependent packages and operating systems.  A large open-source projects can benefit from continually checking that contributors code in Pull Requests/Merges meet standards set by the project.

A large benefit of the strong open-source community for R packages is the wealth of knowledge on building out and up CI/CD.  The lone developer does not need to write CI code from scratch nor does a the 50+ open source community project.

We will showcase

# {admiral}

{admiral} is an open-source R package that seeks to build a modularized toolbox to develop ADaM
datasets.  The package was initially started by a collaboration between GSK and Roche and has since burgeoned to multiple companies and extension packages.
